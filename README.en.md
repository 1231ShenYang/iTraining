Currently, the threshold for EDA and chip design remains high, urgently needing a fast entry EDA learning course. This project aims to create a comprehensive EDA talent training program that is applicable to EDA team technology stack cultivation and practical EDA courses in universities, providing an easy-to-use EDA learning solution. Learners will be able to understand the basic process of EDA development, master the fundamentals of C++ and EDA, and possess initial backend development engineering practical capabilities upon completion of this project.
